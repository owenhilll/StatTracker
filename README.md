# StatTracker
Stattracker is a powerful web application that utilizes node.js runtime environment to display statistics from several professional sporting leagues. BACKEND: Pull_data.js contains a javascript function that pulls data from https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-baseball using node.js fetch. THe function unitlizes Javascript schedule feature to pull the data at a specified time. Using SQl, I then pushed the statistics into a Database table called stats. The stats table contained five columns(name, wins, losses, pointfor, pointsagainst). Once complete, the route stats.js would load the appropirate statistics for each team by searching through the stats table until the teamname was located. Once located, the team statistics were sent to localhost:5000/stats/'TeamName'. On the front end, the main page is titled home.html. Once the user selects a team from the dropdown, an ajax call located inside the function loadStates() is used to pull that teams statistcs from localhost. The statistcs are then displayd onto the webpage.
